# 1). Write a Python program to calculate the area of a parallelogram ?

FORMULA OF PARALLELOGRAM : 
                       
     Area of parallelogram = Base * Height   
--->> Note: A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel (and therefore opposite angles equal).
            A quadrilateral with equal sides is called a rhombus, 
                                                            and a parallelogram whose angles are all right angles is called a rectangle.
----->> The parallelogram is a geometrical figure of a four-sided plane with opposite sides parallel. 
                    A parallelogram is a simple object in 2D space that has two parallel sides. 
                                        The opposite sides and the angles are identical in a parallelogram.
