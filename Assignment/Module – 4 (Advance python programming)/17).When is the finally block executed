When is the finally block executed? 

===>The finally block always executes when the try block exits. 
    This ensures that the finally block is executed even if an unexpected exception occurs.

=====> syntex:-

 try:
    # some code that might raise an exception
    ...
except ExceptionType:
    # handle the exception
    ...
finally:
    # some code that should always be executed, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not
    ...
