4.How memory is managed in Python?

Memory management is very important for software developers to work efficiently with any programming language.
As we know, Python is a famous and widely used programming language. 
It is used almost in every technical domain. 
In contrast to a programming language, memory management is related to writing memory-efficient code. 
We cannot overlook the importance of memory management while implementing a large amount of data. 
Improper memory management leads to slowness on the application and the server-side components. 
It also becomes the reason of improper working. 
If the memory is not handled well, it will take much time while preprocessing the data.
In Python, memory is managed by the Python manager which determines where to put the application data in the memory.
